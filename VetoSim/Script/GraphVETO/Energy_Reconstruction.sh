# This script generates pictures of Reconstructed primary Energy. Since this code

# controls this code, is also written according to the principle of the
# Full_Analysis.sh script.

# re-generate the Inputs.root file:
cd ../../UI/
root -l -q SetParameters.cpp

# Now write our information into the graphics source code:
cd ../Source/Graphics/
sed -i "25 a Counter = $1;" ./Reconstructed_Energy.cpp
sed -i '27 d' ./Reconstructed_Energy.cpp

# But now we also need to put in the type of series.
# fortunately the analysis has produced a file AnalysisTag.txt
# in the Inputs.root-file which consists of exactly the right number:
cd ../../Data/Inputs/
if [ -f "./AnalysisTag.txt" ]
then
read Series < ./AnalysisTag.txt
cd ../../Source/Graphics/
sed -i "28 a Series = ${Series};" ./Reconstructed_Energy.cpp
sed -i '30 d' ./Reconstructed_Energy.cpp

# And now we can actually run the code:
find ./ -type f ! -name "*.*" -exec rm -rf {} \;
rm -rf ./*.o
cp ../../Compile/Graphics/Reconstructed_Energy ./Makefile
make clean
make -j 4
./Reconstructed_Energy
