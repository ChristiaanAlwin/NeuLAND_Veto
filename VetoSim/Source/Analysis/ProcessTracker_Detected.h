  // of one of the primary particles identified in the beginning of our program. The primary particle 
  // that has its primary MC interaction point clostest to this reconstructed point is selected for this.
  // Closest means that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (ct)^2 is minimal. for each reconstructed point a single primary interaction point is found by minimizing
  // this distance. If a primary interaction point is assigned to multiple reconstructed points, the smallest distance is kept and the other reconstructed
  // points are re-assigned. If no primary interaction point can be found for a reconstructed point, then this value becomes -1.
