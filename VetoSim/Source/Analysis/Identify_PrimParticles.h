void Identify_PrimParticles(Leaf_Structure* TheLeafs, Inputs_Structure* Inputs, Tree_Structure* AnaTree, Int_t const Event, Int_t const Counter, TRandom3* generator)
{
  // This function identifies the primary particles within a single event and puts the results
  // into the analysis tree. Therefore no outputs are required. The inputs are the pointers
  // to the 3 structures that hold all our information and the number of the current event.
  // We also pass the TRandom3 generator along as non-=const so that seeds are updated every time.
  
  // NOTE: AnaTree should NOT be const, otherwise we cannot modify the structure.
  
  // Written by C. A. Douma, for the R3B collaboration
  
  // =============================================================================================
  // First we do our calculations. In order to identify the primary particles,
  // we will loop over all Monte Carlo points. We will then track each point back 1 step.
  // Then if the point (daughter) goes from inside the primary volume to outside (parent), 
  // we know that the parent is a primary particle. If the daughter is outside this volume,
  // we test if the track goes through the volume. In that case the parent is also a primary particle.
  // else it is not a primary particle.
    
  // FIXME 2 problems with this code:
  // 1. Sometimes 0 primary particles are registered when 1 tries to duplicate results from previous simulations
  //    This is because for these events, the primary track does not change track number, while it DOES enter
  //    the volume that identifies primary particles! Hence this code thinks the track never entered.
  // 2. Sometimes too many primary particles are registered. This is because a particle can loop back
  //    through the air and re-enter the primary volume. Then this code thinks it is a new particle, while
  //    it actually is not! This is not a problem, just an artifact of this code.
