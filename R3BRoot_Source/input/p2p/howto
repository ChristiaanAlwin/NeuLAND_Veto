The output is quasi.root and quasi.out (a text file). 

Uses Valerii Panin's code, in turn based on the QFS fortran code by Leonid Chulkov.

You can use the quasi.out as an input for the R3Bp2pGenerator.

To use, for example

cd r3broot/macros/r3b/califa/TUM

In iPhos_sim.C

  TString fGene="p2p";

In r3ball.C

  if (fGenerator.CompareTo("p2p") == 0  ) {
    R3Bp2pGenerator* gen = new R3Bp2pGenerator("$VMCWORKDIR/input/p2p/build/quasi.out");
    primGen->AddGenerator(gen);
  }
  
  root -l iPhos_sim.C
