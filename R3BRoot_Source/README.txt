This branch of R3BRoot is created to work with
FairSoft and FairRoot master branch 2016 and with ROOT version 5.

This branch can be build directly on top of this.

To perform VETO simulations, go to R3BRoot/VetoSim/Exp/
and follow the instructions of the README.txt there to
perform one of the pre-defined simulations.

All simulations performed in C. A. Douma his PhD thesis
are contained in this folder.

To customize your own simulation, go to R3BRoot/VetoSim/UI/
and adapt the parameters in SetParameters.cpp as you like.
Then use the control scripts in this folder to run your
simulation.

Some additional explanation is contained in R3BRoot/VetoSim/Manual.txt

Contact C. A. Douma (c.a.douma@rug.nl) for further questions.
